In this section, you'll deepen your CNN knowledge and learn about concepts that will allow you to reuse pretrained models from other image recognition tasks.

The use of a convolutional base, or a \"pretrained network\" has the advantage that hierarchical features that already have been \"pre-learned\" by this network can act as a generic model. Because of that reason, these networks can be used for a wide variety of computer vision tasks, even if your new problem involves completely different classes of images. You'll learn about the pretrained networks that are available in Keras, the use of pretrained networks through feature extraction (meaning that you run your new data through the pretrained network and training a new classifier on top of the pretrained network), and the use of pretrained networks through finetuning.\n", "\n", "\n", "### Image Classification \n", "\n", "At the end of this section, you'll work through a lab that combines the knowledge you gained in this section and the previous one.
